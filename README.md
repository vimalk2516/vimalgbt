# Indian Law AI: Fine-Tuning Falcon-7B & LLAMA 2 Language Models

Welcome to our exciting project where we are adapting two cutting-edge language models, Falcon-7B & LLAMA 2, to become proficient in Indian law. 

## Overview

Our adventure began with a modest 150 Q&As on Indian law. Now, we're charging ahead with an impressive dataset of 3300 instructions! This AI legal project combines:

- **Falcon-7B & LLAMA 2**: State-of-the-art language models, prepped and ready for legal training.
- **PEFT & QLoRA**: The dream duo for memory-efficient and high-performance model fine-tuning.
- **[Our Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nisaar/Articles_Constitution_3300_Instruction_Set)**: Comprehensive Indian law knowledge, spanning constitutional law, civil rights, and more!







## Dive into our Dataset

Our dataset is designed with four key features: `instruction`, `input`, `output`, and `prompt`. Crafted to shape our models into AI law experts!
